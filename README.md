# SpaceLander

**Version 1.0.0**

You are in control of a space lander ship, descending to the surface of the celestial body for a landing. Gravity steadily accelerates your ship faster and faster toward the surface. You, the astronaut piloting the ship, have a single control: a button with the label "thrust" on it. Applying thrust slows your ship down. Your goal is to get your ship to land at a slow enough speed so that it doesn't crash on impact. What's the catch? You have only a limited amount of fuel. If you slow down your ship too much too early, you will run out of fuel and crash into the surface.

To get started run the following line
```python lander.py```
